# ðŸŽ¬ Movie API - A Golang Project for Movie Lovers!

Welcome to **Movie API**, a fully featured RESTful API built in **Golang** for managing movie data. This API supports CRUD operations, user authentication, and integration with **Nexus** for artifact management, with a CI/CD pipeline set up using **Jenkins**.

## ðŸš€ Features

- **Full CRUD Operations**: Create, read, update, and delete movies with ease.
- **Filter, Sort & Paginate**: Search and organize movie data.
- **User Registration & Authentication**: Secure user access with token-based authentication.
- **Welcome & Activation Emails**: Send welcome and account activation emails automatically.
- **Monitoring & Logging**: Includes structured logging, error handling, rate limiting, and application health checks.
- **Cross-Origin (CORS) Support**: Access the API across different origins.
- **Metrics**: Track usage and performance stats with built-in metrics.

## ðŸ”§ CI/CD Pipeline with Jenkins and Nexus

This project comes with an automated **CI/CD pipeline** to streamline your development process:

- **Jenkins**: Automates the build and deployment process.
- **Nexus**: Manages Docker images and binary artifacts.
- **Docker**: Containerizes the application for easy deployment.

The pipeline handles building, testing, and pushing Docker images to **Nexus**, as well as publishing raw artifacts for your movie API project.

## ðŸ›  Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following:

- **Go 1.23.1**
- **PostgreSQL** for data storage
- **Docker** (optional, for containerization)
- **Nexus** repository for Docker and raw file storage
- **Jenkins** (for CI/CD pipeline automation)

### Database Configuration

To configure your database, fill in the following details:

1. **Set up your PostgreSQL database** with your credentials.
2. **Update the `.env` file** with your **Greenlight DB** credentials:

```bash
DB_USER=<your_db_user>
DB_PASSWORD=<your_db_password>
export GREENLIGHT_DB_DSN="postgres://<your_db_user>:<your_db_password>@db/<your_db_name>?sslmode=disable"
DB_NAME=<your_db_name>
```

### Setup

1. **Clone This Project**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Advanced-Patterns-For-Building-Json-Apis-and-web-applicattions.git
   cd greenlight
   ```

2. **Configure Environment Variables**  
   Set up the `.env` file with your database and email configurations.

3. **Run Database Migrations**
   ```bash
   make db/migrations/up
   ```

4. **Start the API Server**
   ```bash
   make run/api
   ```

You're ready to start using the API! ðŸŽ‰
